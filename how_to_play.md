# How to play

- For the first turn (indicated by no last played cards in the middle), you have to play the diamond three either as a single, pair or in combination.
- Then you have to play either single, pair or combination bigger than the last played cards.
- If everyone skip their action (indicated by the last played card is the cards that you last played), you can play any single, pair or combination.
- The first one to play all their cards wins.
